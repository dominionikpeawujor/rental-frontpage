# Rental Website Frontpage

I did a self reflection and realized that after learning typescript, google cloud and testing out these technologies, I lost confidence in my HTML, CSS and vanilla javascript. Turns out that I had some learning gaps I needed to close up.

I took up this project to gain some confidence and learn new aspect of these languages. 

*PS*: No matter what framework you are trying to learn, you will always need to know HTML. You can't escape it✌🏾.
